## about me 
my name is **Abdulkareem Abunabhan** am 24 years old, i graduated architectural department at sep,2022. and am excited to learn many things about programming in the way for me to become a *full stack developer*.

## what i learned from my reading
one of the most important thing about a developer is the mindset.
As a developer I need to know that the purpose of any code is ***to help people*** and in order to help people my software must be **simple as posible** : cause the more simple the code is the more easy it is to understand , maintanice , add feature or even modify. 

To avoid being victum for the complexity I have three steps :
1. understand the software purpose and it's defenation.
2. Be simple as possible.
3. evaluate the new feature request depending on software purpose and question them.

and I learned to always keep learning.
